      <h3>What We Do</h3>
      <p>CMTâ€™s Outreach team conducts face-to-face communication and training in communities.

CMT reaches millions of youth through high end dramas which imbue positive messaging about growing up in South Africa. CMT employs community mobilisers and trainers who work to inform, educate and inspire people and communities about how they can take an active part in managing and improving their own health.

CMT is unique because all of our media, television production, training material, brand development and script writing is done in house. Campaigns and projects go through all stages of creation, implementation and delivery.</p>
